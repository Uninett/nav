# The following modules are really sub-requirements of Twisted, not of
# NAV directly.  They may be optional from Twisted's point of view,
# but they are required for parts of the Twisted library that NAV uses:
#
# PyOpenSSL is required for TLS verification during PaloAlto API GET operations
PyOpenSSL==23.3.0
# service-identity is required to make TLS communication libraries shut up about potential MITM attacks
service-identity==21.1.0
