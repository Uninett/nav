Finally switched from NAV's homegrown authentication system to Django's own.
This makes NAV compatible with a lot of 3rd party libraries, and is a necessary
step to support MFA.

This is a big change. Test thoroughly before putting this version into
production. This is especially important if REMOTE_USER support is enabled.
NAV's classic REMOTE_USER support has a lot of bells and whistles that Django's
support lacks. We have added support for NAV's config options but it is
a little used feature. There should be no need to update the confg file.
