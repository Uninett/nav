Auditlog entries now store sortable display names for actor, object, and target, enabling sorting and searching on these columns. Links to detail pages are shown when the referenced object still exists.

**Note:** The database migration includes backfill operations to populate sortkey columns for existing log entries. On deployments with millions of log entries, this migration may take some time to complete.
