class TimestampChecker(object):
    """Generic handling of SNMP time stamp checking.

    Various MIBs provide last-updated timestamps for potentially large
    tables. These timestamps are usually reported as the value of sysUpTime
    when the last table modification was made.

    A manager should collect such a timestamp before collecting a large
    table. If the timestamp is unchanged on the next collection run, then it
    needn't waste time collecting the unchanged table over again.

    Some tables will have a timestamp of 0, meaning it was last changed at the
    time the SNMP agent was initialized. If the SNMP agent has been
    re-initialized or the device rebooted, the timestamp may still be 0, while
    the table contents have changed.  Therefore, the manager should check for
    deviations in the expected sysUpTime value - if it appears the device has
    restarted, it's time to collect the full table again, to be on the safe
    side.

    This class provides re-usable mechanisms for doing these operations in an
    ipdevpoll context.  It can perform the sysUpTime collection and receive
    the results of other timestamp query results, persist these to the NAVdb
    and/or compare them with previously persisted values to determine whether
    table re-collection should occur.
