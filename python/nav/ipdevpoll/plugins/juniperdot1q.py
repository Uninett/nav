"""ipdevpoll plugin to collect 802.1q VLAN information, but with a workaround
for Juniper's moronic munging of VLAN tags in the Q-BRIDGE-MIB.

"What's that", you say? Well, Juniper has their own creative interpretation
of the Q-BRIDGE-MIB (RFC 4363). They think they can omit real VLAN tags as
identifiers in the MIB, and use some opaque internal identifier instead. To
find out which actual VLAN tag the identifier represents, you will need to
consult a mapping in the proprietary JUNIPER-VLAN-MIB.

The really funny part is that, when first discovered, this was reported as a
bug against Q-BRIDGE-MIB::dot1qPvid (Which NAV basically uses to find the
native/untagged VLAN of each switch port) - Juniper admitted that this was a
mistake and fixed the bug, so now, dot1qPvid reports actual VLAN tags.
However, when the same problem was discovered and reported for
dot1qVlanStaticTable (which NAV uses to discover which ports are tagged on
each VLAN), Juniper refused to admit that their interpretation of the MIB was
wrong, and now keep munging that table's index by using opaque, internal
identifiers. So Juniper devs are morons. Who knew?

The following can be used as proof of stupidity^W^W^W reference material:
