"""Dispatcher for external HTTP service.

This dispatcher sends SMS via a webserver accepting information sent trough a
HTTP GET request.

It requires parameters for username, passord and group, in addition to
reciever and SMS message.

It has been made for working with the SMS gateway used by the University of
Oslo, but could be useful for other similar solutions.
