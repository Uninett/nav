# This file contains configuration for JWT issuers that this NAV instance
# should accept tokens from.

# Each issuer is defined in a section. The name of the section should be
# the issuers name, the same value as the 'iss' claim will be in tokens
# generated by this issuer. This value is often a URL, but does not
# have to be.

# Each section must contain an _aud_ option. NAV will only accept
# tokens from this issuer where the 'aud' claim matches the value of _aud_.

# The _keytype_ option defines what kind of key the _key_ option contains.
# The value can be either JWKS or PEM.

# The _key_ option contains the key matching the _keytype_ option.
# If _keytype_ is JWKS, then _key_ must contain a URL to an endpoint
# exposing a JWKS object. If _keytype_ is PEM, then _key_ must contain
# a path to a file that contains a public key in PEM format.

# Example 1 (Issuer with _keytype_ JWKS)

# [https://issuer-with-url-name.no]
# aud=nav-instance-url
# keytype=JWKS
# key=https://some-url/jwks

# Example 2 (Issuer with _keytype_ PEM)

# [issuer-with-simpler-name]
# aud=nav-instance-url
# keytype=PEM
# key=/some/path/public_key.pem
