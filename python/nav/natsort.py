"""Implements natural string sorting.

Natural sorting of strings implies that e.g. the string 'foo20bar' will sort
after 'foo3bar' instead of before.

An example of how to naturally sort a directory listing (case insensitive):

  import os, natsort
  foo = os.listdir('/path/to/bar')
  foo.sort(natsort.inatcmp)

Note that this example is highly inefficient, as the inatcmp function has to be
called at least O(n log n) times.  If you are running Python 2.4 or higher, the
more effective way to sort the list foo would be:

  foo.sort(key=natsort.split)

This will pre-generate the list of sorting keys.  If you do not have Python 2.4
or higher, you should use the decorate-sort-undecorate pattern to achieve
maximum efficiency.
