"""Reduction of network adjacency candidates graph.

This module uses NetworkX to facilitate reduction of NAV's network adjacency
candidates graph (loaded from the adjacency_candidate table) into a proper
physical topology graph.

The adjacency_candidate_netbox table can be loaded as a directed graph, from
which reduction can take place.

The graph can be analyzed and reduced by using the AdjacencyReducer class.


Graph structure
===============

A proper adjacency graph must consist only of Box and Port objects, as defined
in this module.

Netbox nodes must only have outgoing edges to Port nodes representing the
Netbox' own interfaces.

Port nodes can have outgoing edges to other Port nodes, or to Netbox nodes
