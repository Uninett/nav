"""cam record storage and handling.

Updating NAV's cam table goes rougly like this:

* Load all open CAM records for the current netbox.

  - In the database, an open cam record is considered one whose
    end_time='infinity' or whose miss_count is NON-NULL.

* An ifindex+mac combination the collector found, which wasn't already in the
  list of open records is added as a new record, with end_time='infinity' and
  miss_count=0.

* An ifindex+mac combination the collector found which is also among the open
  records is left untouched, unless its miss_count <> 0; in such a case the
  miss_count is reset to 0.

* If an ifindex+mac combination from the open records list is not found by the
  collector, we ensure it's end_time is set to anything but infinity, and its
  miss_count is incremented by one.

  - If a record's miss_count becomes greater or equal to MAX_MISS_COUNT, the
    miss_count is set to a NULL value.

The point of miss_count in this algorithm is that closed cam records have a
grace period of MAX_MISS_COUNT collector runs.  If a "closed" cam record is
found again within MAX_MISS_COUNT collector runs, the existing record can be
reclaimed by resetting end_time to infinity.
