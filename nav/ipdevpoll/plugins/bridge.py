"""ipdevpoll plugin to collect bridge data.

This plugin doesn't do much except find baseport numbers for switch
ports, using the BRIDGE-MIB.  The plugin also supports multiple
BRIDGE-MIB instances if they are listed as logical entities in
ENTITY-MIB. The plugin also fetches the base bridge address from the bridge mib
