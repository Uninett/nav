"""Message handling for NAV.

A message is stored in a user's session and can be displayed to the
user to give confirmation, warnings or other types of messages.

This was originally written to work with NAV sessions under mod_python,
before we supported a Django version with its on Message framework. Most
usage of this module can be replaced with Django's Message framework instead.
