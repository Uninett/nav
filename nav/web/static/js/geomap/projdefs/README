This directory contains copies of certain projection definitions for
Proj4js[1] from Spatial Reference[2].  The files contain all necessary
definitions for UTM projections (using WGS84 reference ellipsoid) of
the whole world (except the polar areas).

Proj4js will download these automatically as needed from Spatial
Reference if they are not available otherwise, but it is convenient to
have a local copy to avoid waiting.  The automatic download is done
asynchronously, so it is much easier for users of Proj4js to assume
that all definitions are already available.  See [3].


File contents:

EPSG326xx.js -- all definitions for the northern hemisphere
EPSG327xx.js -- all definitions for the southern hemisphere
EPSG32601.js |
    .        |
    .         > definitions for each zone
    .        |
EPSG32760.js |
fetch.sh     -- script used to download the above files

Usage:

Include EPSG326xx.js and EPSG327xx.js together with Proj4js.
