"""Functionality to enable any Apache-served resources to be protected by
NAV's authentication and authorization system, by the use of mod_python.

To protect a resource served by Apache using this module, add something like
the following to your Apache-config::

  <Location /protected-resource>
      PythonHeaderParserHandler nav.web.modpython
  </Location>


Known issues
------------

mod_python itself is no longer maintained, and therefore deprecated,
which is why the rest of NAV has completely moved to Django,
with a suggested WSGI-based configuration.
