    Arguments:

                                 argument and returns a list of its dependent
                                 objects.

    Returns:

       A dictionary describing the edges/arcs between the nodes in the graph:

       {'A': ['B', 'C'],  # Directed edges from 'A' to 'B' and 'C'
        'B': ['D'],       # Directed edges from 'B' to 'D'
