"""The dispatchers package contains all the methods that alertengine can use to
send out alerts. Adding new messaging channels is a simple matter of writting
a new subclass of ``dispatcher'' overriding send with the following:

    def send(self, address, alert, language='en'):

address - the alertaddress object that is "sending" the alert
  alert - the alertqueue object that we want to send out an notification about

The address to send to is `address.address`. To get the message we want to send
simply call `alert.messages.get(language=language, type='your_message_type')`

For your dispatchers logging please use
`logging.getlogger('nav.alertengine.dispatchers.your_dispatcher')` and try to
use sensible log messages, look at the modules that ship with NAV for
examples.
