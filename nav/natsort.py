"""Implements natural string sorting.

Natural sorting of strings implies that e.g. the string 'foo20bar' will sort
after 'foo3bar' instead of before.

An example of how to naturally sort a directory listing:

  import os, natsort
  foo = os.listdir('/path/to/bar')
  foo.sort(key=natsort.split)
"""
import re

_split_pattern = re.compile(r'(\d+|\D+)')


def split(string):
    """Split a string into digit- and non-digit components."""
    def intcast(n):
        if n.isdigit():
            return int(n)
        else:
            return n

    return [intcast(x) for x in _split_pattern.findall(string)]
