This script automates the task of merging the four NAV 3.4 databases
into a single multi-namespaced NAV 3.5 database.

Usage: $(basename $0): [-d dbname] [-u dbuser] [-D] [-n]

Options:
  -d dbname      specify the name of the database to create and merge to, 
                 default value is nav
  -u dbuser      specify the name of the database user to own the database
                 and the relations therein, default value is nav
  -D             don't create a database, assume dbname already exists
  -l path        path to the directory where dump files will be created,
                 default is the current working directory
  -n             do not create dump files, assume they already exist in 
                 the dump path (manage-dump.sql, navprofiles-dump.sql,
                 logger-dump.sql arnold-dump.sql)

Environment variables:
  PGHOST         the postgresql host to connect to
  PGPORT         the port postgresql listens to
  PGUSER         the postgresql user to connect as when creating the
                 database and dumping/loading data from the old ones,
                 should be a superuser
  PGPASSWORD     the password to use when connecting as \$PGUSER

SUCCESS! Databases manage, navprofiles, logger and arnold were
(apparently) merged into the new $newnavdb database.

Your old NAV databases were not dropped, in case you still want them
for something.  You can delete them manually when they are no longer
needed, by issuing this command as the postgres superuser:

  for db in manage navprofiles logger arnold; do dropdb \$db; done
