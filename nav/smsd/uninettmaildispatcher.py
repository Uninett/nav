"""A dispatcher for Uninett's mail-to-SMS gateway.

This dispatcher sends SMS messages via Uninett's mail-to-SMS gateway. The
gateway accepts e-mails with the recipient's phone number in the subject and
the text message in the body. The mail must be sent from a uninett.no host,
so this is of little use for others, unless they have a similar interface.
