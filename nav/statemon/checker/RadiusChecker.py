class RadiusChecker(AbstractChecker):
    """
    Radius Monitor-client.

    Handles Radius-servers. It tries to authenticate like for example any
    VPN-concentrator from Cisco would.

    Future enhancements would be to check if we get a certain attribute
    back from the server, and what the value of that attribute would be.
    For now, we just connect and authenticate to radius.

    Arguments:
    ----------
    hostname  : Accessible from self.get_address() as pure FQDN hostname
    port      : Remote udp-port where radius authentication is living.
                Port 1812 is default for authentication.
    username  : A valid radius-username
    password  : Clear-text password associated with the username above.
    identifier: Each "client-source" connects to radius with a given
                identity and secret.
    rad_secret: Password associated with 'identifier'
    dictionary: Path to filename which holds the dictionary for this
                radius-daemon. The default-dictionary can be used, or
                a specific dictionary for a specific implementation
                of the radius-server.

    Return values:
    --------------
    Successful connection:
        return Event.UP, "Radius: " + version/implementation (if we find it)
    Failure to connect:
        return Event.DOWN, str(sys.exc_value)
