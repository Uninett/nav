    A MibRetriever for retrieving information from Geist branded

    Based on the GEIST-MIB-V3, which is more or less derived from the
    IT-WATCHDOGS-MIB-V3. Objects names in the derived MIB are mostly the
    same, except for a `cm` prefix on notification objects, which has changed
    to the `gst` prefix. This implementation does not use the notification
    objects for anything, so we don't need to care about this name change here.
