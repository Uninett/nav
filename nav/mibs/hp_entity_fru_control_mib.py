"""Implements a wrapper around HpIcfFanMib- and HpIcfPowerSupplyMib-classes.
This is more convenient than calling both.

The reason why it is implemented this way is that the classes are operating
on two different MIBs,- and we need to keep them apart.  Therfore it is not
possible to use inheritance.  Call it cheating,- well it works perfectly...
