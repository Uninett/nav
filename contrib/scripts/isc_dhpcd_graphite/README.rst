Usage and notes for isc_dhcpd_graphite
======================================

This script needs python3.

For arguments, try::

        isc_dhcpd_graphite.py --help

The script runs ``dhcpd_pool`` (full path given with -C) with the flag
``-f j`` to make it emit json.

Building the prefix
===================

The dotted-path that graphite uses to store data is controlled by the prefix
argument to the script (-p), the optional location argument (-l) and what
``dhcpd_pool`` returns as its ``location`` key.

The default prefix is "nav.dhcp".

If ``-p`` is "nav.bloviate", ``-l`` is not set and the ``location`` in the json
is "vlan1" the resulting graphite path is ``nav.bloviate.vlan1``.


Assumptions about Location
--------------------------

The script will escape the location-string to make a valid graphite key, that
is: replace any signs not in [-A-Za-z0-9_] with an underscore. A "location" of
the form "10.0.0.1/24" will be transformed to "10_0_0_1_24". If there are no
valid letters left after the escape, a warning is issued on stderr and that
row of results is not passed on to graphite.

Extracting a vlan from locations
--------------------------------

If the flag '--extract-vlan' is used, it will be assumed that the value of the
``location``-key contains a vlan-name of the form "vlanNUMBER", regex
``vlan\d+``. If this is not the case, a warning is issued on stderr and that
row of results is not passed on to graphite.

The location-value is normalized so that a value of "Student vlan2 new" is sent
to graphite as "vlan2".
