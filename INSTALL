Dependencies
============
This section should specify what packages are needed to build and run NAV.  Be
aware that many of these packages have dependencies of their own.

Build requirements
------------------
To build NAV, you need at least the following:

 * make
 * autoconf
 * ant
 * Perl >= 5.6.0
 * Python >= 2.4.0
 * Java 2 SDK >= 1.5.0
 * Tomcat >= 4 (or compatible Java Servlet API)
 * JavaSnmp >= 1.4 (A.K.A Drexel SNMP)
 * Cheetah Templates

Runtime requirements
--------------------
To run NAV, these software packages are required:

 * Apache2
 * mod_python
 * Cricket
 * PostgreSQL >= 8.0
 * rrdtool
 * Cheetah Templates
 * Tomcat >= 4 (or compatible Java Servlet Container)
 * Java 2 SDK >= 1.5.0
 * Perl >= 5.6.0
 * Python >= 2.4.0

The following Perl modules are required:

 * DBD::Pg
 * Pg
 * SNMP_Session (with SNMP_util, BER)

The following Java librares are required:

 * PostgreSQL JDBC driver
 * JavaSnmp >= 1.4 (A.K.A Drexel SNMP)

The following python modules are required:

 * django (>= 1.0)
 * egenix-mxdatetime
 * forgethtml
 * forgetsql
 * ipy
 * ldap
 * psycopg
 * psycopg2
 * pysnmp2
 * rrd


Recommended add-ons
-------------------
If you want to connect a mobile phone to your NAV server and enable SMS alerts
in alert profiles, you will need to install the Gammu and python-gammu
packages.  The SMS damon can use plugins to dispatch SMS'es through other
means, but using Gammu as an SMS dispatcher is the default.



Installing NAV
==============
To install NAV, do the following::

  ./configure
  make
  make install

If you wish to configure NAV to run from a different location than the default
/usr/local/nav you should specify a new directory using the --prefix= option of
the configure script, e.g. "./configure --prefix=/opt/nav".

If you are building an RPM package (or similar) of NAV, you may wish to have
the files installed in a physically different location (a temporary build
directory) than what you configured the package for.  In this case, you should
specify this build directory by adding "DESTDIR=/your/build/directory" to "make
install" command. You should also have a look at whatever .spec files you can
find below the packages/ directory. 

Java libraries
--------------
Before building, you must make sure that the JavaSNMP (from drexel.edu) and the
Java Servlet API are both available on your JVM's CLASSPATH.  If they are not,
you need to explicitly add them to the CLASSPATH environment variable before
running `make` as described above.

If both libraries are located in /usr/share/java/, then something like this
should be appropriate::

  export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/servletapi.jar:/usr/share/java/libsnmp.jar
