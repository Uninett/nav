# NAV eventengine configuration

[timeouts]
#
# This section configures timeout values for alert quarantines. A quarantine
# is when one or multiple alerts are held back for a period of time, while
# waiting for the problem to resolve itself. It is a protection against a
# torrent of alerts for things that are rapidly flapping. 
#
# All options are commented out with default values. Uncomment to change the
# defaults. Valid units are s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours, d=days.
#

# When a boxDown event is received, how long to wait for resolve before
# sending out a boxDownwarning.
;boxDown.warning = 1m

# When a boxDown event is received, how long to wait for resolve before
# finally declaring the IP device as down.
;boxDown.alert = 4m

# When a moduleDown event is received, how long to wait for resolve before
# sending out a moduleDownWarning.
;moduleDown.warning = 1m

# When a moduleDown event is received, how long to wait for resolve before
# finally declaring the module as down.
;moduleDown.alert = 4m

# When a linkDown event is received, how long to wait for resolve before
# finally declaring the link as down.
;linkDown.alert = 4m

# When an snmpAgentDown event is received, how long to wait for resolve before
# finally declaring the SNMP agent as down.
;snmpAgentDown.alert = 4m

# When a bgpDown event is received, how long to wait for resolve before
# finally declaring the BGP session to be down.
;bgpDown.alert = 1m

[linkdown]
# This section contains options to control which link down events to
# send alerts about. Also see settings in ipdevpoll.conf about which links to
# generate events for in the first place.

# When enabled, only link loss on redundant links cause alerts to be sent.
# The rationale is that on a non-redundant link, you will get boxDown alerts
# for the devices behind that link, which are now unreachable.
;only_redundant = yes

# If a linkDown event is posted for a switch port that doesn't carry any of
# these vlans (tagged or untagged), no alert is sent. This is a
# space-separated list of VLAN tag numbers. An empty value means no filtering
# based on VLAN.
