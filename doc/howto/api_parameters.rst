==================
NAV API Parameters
==================

Here you will find documentation about each endpoint in NAVs API.


Searches
========

On some endpoints you can do searches. This is done by using the search
parameter::

  api/netbox?search=some-sw

The list of fields used in the search are defined for each endpoint. Searches
are case-insensitive and do partial matches.


Filters
=======

Almost all endpoints supports filtering. This is done by specifying a value for
the field you want to filter on::

  api/netbox?room=a-room
  api/netbox?category=GSW


Detailed endpoint specifications
================================


api/alert/
----------

  - ``on_maintenance=on`` - also list alerts regarding subjects on maintenance
  - ``stateless=on`` - also list stateless alerts (from the last 24 hours)
  - ``stateless_threshold=<hours>`` - adjust stateless interval



api/arp/[<id>]
--------------

Provides access to NAVs ARP data

:Search: None

:Filters: ip, mac, netbox, prefix

:Additional parameters:
  - active=on - list only entries that are active now (end_time = infinity)


api/cam/[<id>]
--------------

Provides access to NAVs CAM data

:Search: None

:Filters: mac, netbox, ifindex, port

:Additional parameters:
  - active=on - list only entries that are active now (end_time = infinity)


api/interface/[<id>]
--------------------

Provides access to NAVs interface data

:Search: ifalias, ifdescr, ifname

:Filters: ifname, ifindex, ifoperstatus, netbox, trunk, ifadminstatus, iftype,
          baseport

api/maintenance/
----------------
Create a maintenance task with the given components.

Supports POST requests:

POST: Returns the created maintenance task or an error. Requires a dict of the form::

  {
    "start_time": "2025-09-29T11:11:11",
    "end_time": "2025-09-29T13:11:11",
    "no_end_time": false,
    "description": "Changing out old equipment in serverroom",
    "location": [1, 2],
    "room": ["myroom", "secondroom"],
    "netbox": [1, 2],
    "service": [1, 2],
    "netboxgroup": [1, 2]
  }

Set ``no_end_time`` to ``true`` and remove the ``end_time`` entry if the maintenance
task does not have a determined end time yet.

The required fields are ``start_time``, ``end_time`` or ``no_end_time``,
``description`` and at least one component id (``location``, ``room``, ``netbox``,
``service`` or ``netboxgroup``).

api/netbox/[<id>]
-----------------

Provides access to NAVs netbox data

:Search: sysname

:Filters: ip, sysname, room, organization, category


api/netboxentity/[<id>]
---------------

Provides access to NAV's collected physical entities information
(I.e. physical contents of IP Devices, in most cases collected from `ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalTable`)

:Search: None

:Filters: netbox, physical_class


api/room/[<id>]
---------------

Provides access to NAVs room data

:Search: None

:Filters: location, description


api/prefix/[<id>]
-----------------

Provides access to NAVs prefix data

:Search: None

:Filters: vlan, net_address, vlan__vlan, contains_address

    .. NOTE:: The vlan__vlan is used to filter on vlan number as the vlan field
              references the primary key only.
              e.g. :code:`prefix?vlan__vlan=<vlan-number>`


api/prefix/routed
-----------------

List all prefixes that are routed

:Search: None

:Filters: None

:Additional parameters:
  - ``family=<4|6>`` - List only prefixes within the specified family


api/prefix/usage/[<prefix>]
---------------------------

List usage statistics for prefixes. This fetches the number of active
IP-addresses for each prefix and compares it to the number of possible addresses
on each prefix. If no time interval is specified, fetches the current status

:Search: None

:Filters: None

:Additional parameters:
  - ``start_time=<iso8601>`` - set start time
  - ``end_time=<iso8601>`` - set end time


api/unrecognized-neighbors/[<id>]
---------------------------------

Provide access to NAVs unrecognized neighbor data.

:Search: remote_name

:Filters: netbox, source


api/vendor/
-----------
Returns the vendor(s) for a given MAC address or list of MAC addresses.
This is done by comparing the MAC addresses with a registry of known OUIs.

Supports GET and POST requests:

GET: Returns the vendor for the given MAC address. Requires the MAC address
      as a query parameter ``mac=<str>``.
POST: Returns the vendors for given MAC addresses. Requires the MAC addresses
       as a JSON array.

In either case the MAC addresses must be in a valid format.
Responds with a JSON dict mapping the MAC addresses to the corresponding vendors.
The MAC addresses will have the format `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`. If the vendor for a
given MAC address is not found, it will be omitted from the response.
If no mac address was supplied, an empty dict will be returned.
