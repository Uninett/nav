Hacker's guide to NAV
=====================

If you are contributing code to Network Administration Visualized,
please read this first.


Contributing to NAV
===================

Originally, NAV was a closed source project, initiated by the
Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), and eventually
sponsored by Uninett on behalf of the Norwegian higher education
community.  In 2004, however, NTNU and Uninett started distributing
NAV under the *GNU General Public License*, making it a truly free
software system.

While Uninett and NTNU are still the main contributors to NAV,
developing NAV to support the needs of the Norwegian higher education
community, contributions from third parties is highly appreciated.

We communicate mainly through mailing lists, GitHub_, and the ``#nav`` IRC
channel on *FreeNode*. At times, Uninett also arranges workshops and
gatherings for its customers: Norwegian universities, university colleges and
research institutions.

To contribute:

Go to https://nav.uninett.no/ and

* Join the mailing lists.  The ``nav-dev`` mailing list in
  particular is for discussing NAV development.  So far, this is a
  low traffic list. We can only hope this will change ;-)
* Get a copy of the latest development sources by cloning the
  Git-repository at GitHub_.
* Take a look at the `project reports from previous development projects at
  NTNU <https://nav.uninett.no/wiki/navprojects>`_ (NAVMe, NAVMore, tigaNAV
  and others) - design specifications and other useful bits of historic NAV
  information is mostly to be found in these. Unfortunately, some of the
  oldest project documentation is in Norwegian only. Do not hesitate to ask
  for help on the mailing lists.

.. _submitting_patches:

Submitting patches
------------------

Unless you are submitting one-off fixes for bugs and small issues,
please take the time to discuss your change proposals on the
**nav-dev** mailing list.  This will increase the chances of having
your patches accepted.

Base your patches on the relevant Git branches. If you are submitting
a patch for an issue that affects the latest stable series, base your patch
on that series branch (``<major>.<minor>.x``). If you are submitting
patches containing new features, base them on the ``master`` branch.

Please submit your changes in the form of a *pull request* against the
`official NAV Github repository`__. From there, we can review and
comment on your changes. The entire CI test suite will be automatically
run against your pull request, and the automatic CLA signing process is
initiated by the CLA Assistant.


Contributor License Agreement
-----------------------------

To contribute code to NAV, you need to sign our contributor license
agreement, straightforwardly based on The Free Software Foundation's
`Fiduciary License Agreement 2.0
<https://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/fla.en.html>`_.

To streamline the process, we ask that you *sign it digitally*, as part
of the GitHub pull request process. We have implemented this process
through the help of `CLA assistant`_. The assistant will allow you to
digitally sign the agreement using your Github account. If you create a
pull request against the NAV repository and have not previously signed
our agreement, the assistant will automatically post a comment on your
pull request with instructions on how to do so.

`The full agreement text can be read directly from the GitHub gist used
by the CLA assistant.
<https://gist.github.com/lunkwill42/0ee830087cb7c4ebfab814d34f406ef5>`_


Rationale
~~~~~~~~~

NAV is a software project primarily made by Uninett AS. Uninett is a
non-profit, government-owned limited company, who builds and operates
Norway's national research and education network.

Due to our experiences with FOSS license compatibility issues, and with
switching the 20-year old NAV project explicitly from the GPLv2 to the
GPLv3 license, we have decided to implement a *contributor license
agreement* for NAV. This will help us ease the transition if we in the
future find we need to switch to yet another FOSS license to keep the
project going.

For the sake of transparency, we've chosen FLA-2.0, which is a fairly
standardized agreement. If you already know the terms of the FLA-2.0,
you won't need to read an entirely new license agreement just to
contribute to NAV.

Directory layout
================

A rough guide to the source tree:

=================================  =================================================================
Directory                          Description
=================================  =================================================================
:file:`bin/`                       NAV 'binaries'; executable scripts and programs.
:file:`contrib/`                   User contributed NAV tools. NAV doesn't depend on these, and any
                                   maintenance of them is left up to the original developers. We do
                                   not offer support for these tools.
:file:`doc/`                       User and developer documentation.
:file:`tests/`                     Automated tests.
:file:`tools/`                     Scripts for aiding in various development, build and release
                                   processes.
:file:`python/`                    Python source code.
:file:`python/nav/etc/`            Example/initial configuration files.
:file:`python/nav/web/static/`     Static media such as CSS stylesheets, images and JavaScript to be
                                   served by a webserver.
:file:`python/nav/web/templates/`  Main/global Django HTML templates. More be located in individual
                                   sub-packages/Django apps.
:file:`python/nav/models/sql`      SQL schema definitions.
=================================  =================================================================


Development languages and frameworks
====================================

All NAV back-end code is written in **Python**. The web-based user
interface is implemented using the Python-based **Django** framework. In
addition, there is an increasing amount of **Javascript** in the web-based
user interface.

If you wish to contribute something really useful that doesn't use Python,
we may consider including it in the :file:`contrib/` directory.


Coding style
============

NAV code adheres to the Python style guide documented in :pep:`8`.
Conventions for writing good documentation strings (a.k.a. "docstrings")
are immortalized in :pep:`257`.

Much of the legacy NAV code was, however, written without using any
specific guidelines for coding style. We are working to improve this, and
will accept patches that clean existing code.


Python boilerplate headers
--------------------------

We will only accept code into NAV if it can be licensed under GPL v3.  Each
Python source code file should contain the following boilerplate at the top::

    #
    # Copyright (C) 2008,2009 Somebody
    #
    # This file is part of Network Administration Visualized (NAV).
    #
    # NAV is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the
    # terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 as published by the Free
    # Software Foundation.
    #
    # This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
    # ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
    # FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for
    # more details.  You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
    # License along with NAV. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
    #

In this case, *"Somebody"* is normally you personally, or your employer,
depending on who legally owns the copyright of your contribution.

If a file uses non-ASCII characters, it **must** be encoded as *UTF-8*, and an
encoding statement should be inserted at the top::

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Javascript
----------

When writing Javascript code, try to focus on modules, not pages. If the
code is HTML-related, it should take selectors or objects as input and
concern itself solely about those. This makes for much easier testing and
reuse. And of course - write the tests first.

When the module is done you write a controller for the page that plugs the
needed plugins to the page elements. This should fail gracefully if the
needed elements are not present.

NAV's Javascript uses RequireJS_ - use this to create modules and specify
dependencies.

Pro tip is to create :file:`require_config.dev.js` in :file:`python/nav/web/static/js/``
and add the following configuration to RequireJS:

.. code-block:: javascript

   require.urlArgs = "bust=" +  (new Date()).getTime();

This makes sure your not using cached resources in your browser when
developing, something browsers love to do! See `config-urlArgs
<http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config-urlArgs>`_ in the RequireJS
documentation for details. :file:`require_config.dev.js` is listed in the
repository :file:`.gitignore` file.



Database
========

NAV uses *PostgreSQL* as its database backend.  Namespaces (schemas) are
employed to logically group tables and relations.  NAV versions prior
to 3.5 employed separate PostgreSQL databases instead of namespaces.

The namespaces currently in use are:

=========  ===================================================================
Namespace  Description
=========  ===================================================================
manage     The core knowledge database of NAV, containing all sorts of
           information about the monitored IP Devices, events, alerts,
           network topology and machine tracking data.
profiles   Contains NAV user accounts and groups, user preferences and alert
           profiles.
logger     Anything related to NAV's syslog parser/browser system.
arnold     The port detention system Arnold stores it's data here.
radius     Radius accounting logs, updated directly by FreeRadius' PostgreSQL
           module.
=========  ===================================================================

.. note:: **Django vs. the database schema**

          NAV existed long before Django, which was "shoe-horned" into the
          legacy NAV application at a later stage. As a consequence of this,
          NAV is quite tied to PostgreSQL as the database backend, and does not
          always present itself as as a typical Django application.

	  The most obvious difference, is that NAV does not employ Django's ORM
	  for defining the initial schema or the schema migrations. NAV
	  implements its schema definitions as pure SQL scripts, and implements
	  a home-grown system for schema migrations, which also written as pure
	  SQL.


Connecting to the database (Python)
-----------------------------------

Raw SQL / Legacy database connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To obtain a raw SQL connection to the NAV database, use the legacy API
accordingly, e.g.::

    import nav.db
    # Get a connection to the NAV database
    connection = nav.db.getConnection('default')

The above code will open a connection to NAV's database, or, if a
previous connection with these parameters is already open in the current
process, returns the already existing connection from a connection
pool.

The ``default`` parameter is there for legacy reasons; it specifies the
name of a subsystem. The :file:`db.conf` file allows configuration of
separate database users for each subsystem (known as a *script* in
:file:`db.conf`) of NAV. The default :file:`db.conf` file specifies a
database user for a subsystem called ``default``, and also specifies the
same database user for all known subsystem names. At present, using a
subsystem name that is not configured in :file:`db.conf` will cause
:py:func:`nav.db.getConnection()` to revert to using the ``default`` name.

Django ORM
~~~~~~~~~~

Since version 3.5, NAV has provided Django ORM models for its database.
Unless you have very specific requirements, only solvable by using pure
SQL, you would be best served by accessing the database via the Django
ORM.

Most of these models are defined in submodules in in the
:py:mod:`nav.models` package (since NAV was not originally divided into
separate "Django applications").


Changing the schema / migrations
--------------------------------

The baseline schema is located in :file:`python/nav/models/sql/baseline/` - the
:program:`navsyncdb` program is responsible for running this when creating
a new database. To make a schema change, you **do not** change the
baseline, but go to the :file:`python/nav/models/sql/changes/` directory and create a new
schema change script there.

Schema change scripts as numbered, using the following pattern::

    sc.<major>.<minor>.<point>.sql

The ``<major>`` and ``<minor>`` numbers usually correspond to the major and
minor number of the next NAV release. The ``<point>`` number is a sequence
id - pick the next free number when creating a schema change script.

Remember these points when creating a schema change script:

* Create separate change scripts for unrelated schema changes.
* Remember to write SQL to **migrate** existing data, if necessary.
* Do not use transactional statements - :program:`navsyncdb` will take care
  of that.

To apply your change scripts, just run :program:`navsyncdb`. It will look
inside the ``schema_change_log`` table to see which change scripts have
already been applied, and it will detect your new change script and apply
this to the database.

.. NOTE:: When changing the schema, don't forget to update the Django
          models in the :py:mod:`nav.models` package. An integration
          test exists to verify that the Django models can at least be used
          to run proper SELECT statements against the database.


Version Control
===============

NAV uses Git_ for distributed version control. The official repository
is located at GitHub_ . Fork that and submit pull-requests for review.


Push access
-----------

Push access to the official repositories is limited to developers
employed or commissioned by Uninett.

Testing and Continuous Integration
==================================

Much of NAV is **legacy code**, as defined by *Michael C. Feathers*:
"Code that has no tests".  We have been making an effort to introduce
automated tests into the codebase the past several years, and hope
to improve coverage over time.

All test suites (except those for Javascript) are located in the
:file:`tests/` subdirectory.

Running tests
-------------

We use a combination of pytest_ and tox_ to run the test suite.

There's also a script to produce an entire test environment as a Docker
image and to run the entire test suite inside a Docker container created
from that image. This is actually the same method employed by our Jenkins
build servers to run the test suite. Take a look in the
:file:`tests/docker/` directory.

For an interactive testing session with tox_, you can utilize the Docker image
like thus:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd tests/docker
   $ make
   ...
   $ make shell
   ...
   $ tox -e unit-py35-django111
   ...


Javascript testing
------------------

Testing javascript in NAV is straightforward. We use Karma_ as a testrunner,
Mocha_ as testing framework and Chai_ as assertion library. Assuming you are
inside the Docker CI image:

.. code-block:: sh

   tox -e javascript

This will take of installing the required JS modules using npm, and running the
test suite in three different browsers (Chrome, Firefox and PhantomJS).

All tests are located under :file:`python/nav/web/static/js/test/`. Create new tests
there. For syntax, assertions and related stuff take a look at the tests
already there and the relevant documentation linked above.



Jenkins and Continuous Integration
----------------------------------

We use Jenkins_ multibranch pipelines for continuous integration testing
of NAV. The Jenkins pipeline is defined in :file:`Jenkinsfile`, and is
automatically run every time a change is pushed to a branch in the
offical NAV Github repository, or when a pull request is opened against
this repository.

Our Jenkins installation is available on https://ci.nav.uninett.no/ .

Tips and tricks
===============

Make fixtures for integration testing
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from django.core import serializers
   from nav.models.manage import Netbox

   fixtures = serializers.serialize("xml", Netbox.objects.all()[:2])

Fixtures can so be used in your integration tests by extending
the test case :py:class:`DjangoTransactionTestCase` in :py:mod:`nav.tests.cases`.

See :py:mod:`nav.tests.integration.l2trace_test` for an example on applying
fixtures for your particular test case.

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/serialization/

.. TODO:: Be able to use `django-admin's management command: dumpdata
   <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#dumpdata-appname-appname-appname-model>`_
   to create fixtures.
