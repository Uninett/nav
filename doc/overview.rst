What it is
==========

Network Administration Visualized is an advanced software suite to monitor
large computer networks. It automatically discovers network topology, monitors
network load and outages, and can send alerts on network events by e-mail and
SMS, allowing for flexible configuration of alert profiles.

What NAV does
=============

NAV gives you:

* An overview of your deployed network infrastructure inventory, topology and
  address space allocation/utilization.
* Alerts via e-mail and/or SMS when stuff stops working.
* Traffic, CPU load and environmental sensor statistics.
* The ability to find the access port of any client machine in your network.
* The ability to block or quarantine access ports of network abusers.
* The ability to perform simple access port configuration tasks via web, and
  also to delegate this access to other administrators within your
  organizational hiearchy.

Although NAV specializes in network infrastructure monitoring, it also
provides simple service monitoring for those who have less complex service
monitoring needs.


A brief history of NAV
======================

The first version of Network Administration Visualized was written by the IT
department of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in 1999 to
cover their network monitoring needs, after HP OpenView had failed to meet
their requirements.  At the time, NTNU's campus network had some 20,000 users.

Uninett, the Norwegian National Research and Education Network became
interested in NTNU's work on NAV in 2001 and began sponsoring 50% of its
development costs in exchange for licensing the software to all universities
and university colleges in Norway.

In 2004, both parties agreed to release NAV to the world under the GPL
license, effectively freeing the software.

In 2006, Uninett assumed the main responsibility of maintaining and developing
the software further, and is continually doing so on behalf of its customers,
the Norwegian universities and university colleges, and research network
partners.
