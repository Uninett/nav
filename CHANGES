    gauges and time-series graphs.

  * Added support for the Comet P8541 web probe (remote temperature sensor).

  * UPS-MIB sensors: Fixed wrong value precision on a couple of objects, and
    added support for the full range of data available from the battery,
    input, output and bypass groups.

  * Added a "setup guide"-type tour for first-time SeedDB users.

  * The cdp, tftp, cs_at_vlan and chassis checkboxes in SeedDB's type form
    have been obsolete for several years, and were finally removed from NAV's
    data model. Bulk import and dump formats have been updated accordingly.

  * Even more tweaks and adjustments to improve the new UI.


Version 4.0b5
(released 03 Mar 2014)

 Bugfixes:

  * Fixed various bugs around the web interface, introduced in previous
    releases.

 User-visible features and improvements:

  * Graph widget now has editable title. Default value is taken from from the
    displayed graph.

  * Make global graph controls float on top of viewport when scrolling on a
    page with heaps of port metrics.

  * Added the much sought-after button to clear link alerts from the status
    page.

  * Front page widgets can now be re-ordered by dragging their anchor icon;
    the re-order mode button has been removed.

  * "Add widget" button on the front page was moved to a sliding menu,
    accessible from the plus icon on the right hand side of the screen.


Version 4.0b4
(released 20 Feb 2014)

 User-visible features and improvements:

  * A port metrics tab has been added to IP Device Info, so that all port
    graphs are available on a single page (just like you're used to from
    Cricket).

  * Sub-tabs in IP Device Info are now hyperlinkable.

  * Portadmin UI has been reworked again, based on feedback from NTNU.

  * All users are now presented with a "NAV tour" widget on their front page,
    which will give an interactive tour of the functionality on the new front
    page.

  * Introduced widget for displaying the contents of `welcome-anonymous.txt`
    and `welcome-registered.txt`, as was always present on the NAV 3 front
    page.

  * Introduced button to add any graph displayed in NAV to your front page
    widget dashboard.

  * CPU stats from HP devices are now included in ranked CPU statistics.

  * New button in ranked statistics to switch between regular graph and pie
    chart.

(released 06 Feb 2014)

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#1270095 (APC sensors stored at wrong precision)
  * All VLAN utilization graphs produced error messages in b2.

 User-visible features and improvements:

  * Inserted the new NAV logo, and completely reworked the page footer.

  * UI clean-ups and improvements in front page widgets, login page, Geomap,
    SeedDB, Messages, PortAdmin, Radius, Syslog Analyzer, IP Device Info, room
    photo database, personal preferences page and others.

  * Fixed Internet Explorer 9 brokenness.

  * Tool descriptions have been completely re-authored, and are now also
    available as a subheading inside each tool.


Version 4.0b2
(released 9 Jan 2014)

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#1262644 (seeddb bulk import does not work)
  * LP#1263040 (ipdevinfo should not crash when Graphite-web is not reachable)
  * LP#1267464 (NAV 4 must provide a tool for migrating RRD data from NAV 3)

 User-visible features and improvements:

  Various UI improvements to the room photo database, toolbox dropdown,
  Network Explorer, Geomap and Ranked statistics.


Version 4.0b1
(released 12 Dec 2013)

 User-visible features and improvements:

  * The web-based user interface has been overhauled/redesigned, using the
    Foundation CSS framework. One of the goals of this process is to have
    design elements that are properly re-usable, and a responsive design that
    will work better on small-screen devices.

  * Cricket and RRDtool have been replaced with ipdevpoll plugins for
    time-series data collection and Graphite for data storage and
    presentation. More information about Graphite can be found at
    http://graphite.wikidot.com/ .

  * System and port traffic graphs are now browsable directly in the ipdevinfo
    tool under each IP device or network interface. The advanced user can also
    build more complex, customized graphs from the data collected by NAV by
    utilizing Graphite's own web interface.

  * The threshold management interface has been rewritten from scratch to work
    with data from Graphite.

 These are fairly large, not backwards compatible changes to NAV. Please refer
 to the release notes for upgrade instructions. For testing the 4.0 beta
 version we recommend installing NAV on a separate, perhaps virtual, server,
 and migrate production data according to the data migration howto found in
 the documentation.

Version 3.15.0
(released 19 Sep 2013)

 User-visible features and improvements:

  * Devices' conceptual layering of interfaces is now collected and presented
    in ipdevinfo. This enables you to, among other things, see which physical
    ports comprise a port- or etherchannel. Some vendors also use this to show
    which physical switch-ports are forwarding packets to/from a given VLAN
    interface.

  * The Netmap tool has been redesigned and re-engineered. Multiple
    improvements have been made based on user feedback.

  * The Netmap contents can now be exported/downloaded as an SVG file, but
    this feature is currently only supported by the Google Chrome browser.

  * Multiple parallel links are now indicated by the Netmap by two parallel
    black markers drawn across the link in question. Details of the underlying
    links are are now properly displayed when clicking on the link line.

  * Interactive next-hop neighbor map in new ipdevinfo tab.

  * "What-if" analysis in new ipdevinfo tab displays devices and organizations
    that may be affected if the selected device goes down. Based on NAV's
    topology information.

  * Images with descriptions can be uploaded and attached to rooms. Useful
    for, among other things, photo-documenting the contents of wiring closets.

  * Subcategories have been replaced by cross-category device groups.
    Arbitrary selections of IP devices can be organized into device groups.

  * Potentially out-of-date CAM and ARP records are highlighted in Machine
    Tracker search results.

  * Community strings are censored in SeedDB IP Device listing.

  * Geolocation of rooms can now be set by clicking on interactive map in
    SeedDB.

  * New program enables streamlined dumping and reloading, with optional
    filtering, of the NAV PostgreSQL database. This simplifies beta testing of
    new NAV versions by copying the production database to a test server.

  * 26 more metrics from APC UPS devices are now collected and graphed.

  * mod_python is no longer required; mod_wsgi is the new recommended way to
    deploy the NAV web interface.

 Bugfixes:
  * LP#1055383 (netmap saves a new view when it should update view)
  * LP#1057423 (netmap algorithm indicator turns red when clicking on
                something in left bar)

  * LP#1200514 (power supply daemon bails out if pysnmp_se is not installed)
  * LP#1206510 (ipdevpoll LLDP UnicodeDecodeError)
  * LP#1207722 (Usernames are searched case insensitive in Microsoft AD)
  * LP#1207737 (LDAP authentication crash on non-existant user in Microsoft AD)

                missing)

Version 3.14.159265
(released 27 Jun 2013)

 This release rolls back changes to the camlogging system that were made in
 the 3.14.1592 release. These changes caused cam records to be created
 erroneously and also a massive load increase on the server NAV is running on.
 Upgrading is HIGHLY recommended.

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#1195206 (MAC addresses are logged for most link ports, causing huge load
                increase on NAV server)

Version 3.14.15926
(released 20 Jun 2013)

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#1177754 (SRV and OTHER category devices have no uplinks)
  * LP#1185786 (maintengine.py crashes on any maintenance task with room or
                location components)
  * LP#1185848 (VLAN topology direction is wrong in cases of multiple links
                between two devices)
  * LP#1186193 (Cricket collects statistics from EDGE switches in NAV 3.14.1592)

Version 3.14.1592
(released 25 Apr 2013)

 Important upgrade note:

  * The Cricket trees `switch-ports` and `router-interfaces` have been
    consolidated into a single `ports` tree, where all physical ports' traffic
    stats now also are collected. After running the usual `syncdb.py` command,
    you should run `mcc.py` once manually (as the navcron) user to ensure the
    Cricket config tree is updated right away.

    When everything is up and running again, you can optionally delete the
    `switch-ports` and `router-interfaces` directories from your
    `cricket-config` directory, as they are no longer used by NAV.

  * NAV now supplies its own `subtree-sets` configuration to Cricket. If you
    have made manual changes to your Cricket collection setup and/or this
    file, you may need to update your setup accordingly.

Version 3.13.0b1
(released 14 Dec 2012)

 User-visible features and improvements:

  * The eventEngine has been rewritten to Python. This was the last remaining
    Java component of NAV, meaning Java is no longer needed for installing and
    running NAV.

  * IPv4, IPv6 and MAC host counts for each VLAN is now graphed over time.

  * NAV is now able to detect and graph data from sensors on Cisco Nexus
    devices.

  * Maintenance tasks can now be configured to end automatically when all
    components involved in the task are up.

  * IP Devices that are down can be placed on immediate maintenance until up
    again directly from the status page.

  * Subscriptions to MAC address prefixes are now possible in Macwatch. Use
    with caution!

Version 3.12.0
(released 13 Sep 2012)

 User-visible features and improvements:

  * The Netmap Java applet has been rewritten in JavaScript, with many
    improvements, including, but not limited to, saveable map layouts and VLAN
    topology tracing.  Layer 2 and layer 3 maps are now separate, and
    elinks/peers can optionally be displayed on L3.

  * Searches in the navbar will now return results from rooms and interfaces,
    as well as IP devices.

  * New room view with powerful port overview, enabling sorting, filtering and
    exporting information to CSV files.

  * IP Device Info has been cleaned up, now with more information,
    navigateable via a tabbing interface.

  * A map of registered room locations with status indicators can now be
    embedded in the main page by removing the commented-out sections of the
    `welcome-registered.txt` file.

  * IPv6 traffic counters for router interfaces. Vendor support for this seems
    dismal at the moment, so keep nagging for software updates!  If upgrading
    from previous NAV versions, new cricket configuration templates need to be
    copied; please read the release notes.

  * ipdevpoll now supports both VRRP and HSRP.

  * The maximum number of concurrent collection jobs in an ipdevpoll process
    can now be configured, which is useful in situations where the process
    runs out of resources such as file descriptors.

  * ipdevpoll job runs are now all logged to the database, enabling more
    details and analysis of job statuses in the web interface.  ipdevinfo will
    now display a timestamp for each of the configured jobs, complete with
    status indicators and warnings for jobs that may be overdue.

  * The Maintenance and Messages tool have been migrated from mod_python to
    Django, and especially the former has received some improvements along the
    way.

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#736825  (Replace ip-hostname search in toolbar with a more generic

                ipdevpoll inventory job to fail)

 Various performance-related improvements:

  * More tweaks to avoid producing unnecessary SNMP queries.

  * Switch port detection on Cisco equipment has been improved


Version 3.11.4
(released 31 May 2012)

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#644155 (Network Explorer never returns response to some searches)
  * LP#912276 (Device History Request-URI Too Large)
  * LP#996955 (All sensor stats are named "Sensor", and clutter the ipdevinfo
               view)

  * LP#999606 (dhcping is not documented as requirement for DHCP service
               monitor)

 Various performance-related improvements:

  * Internal caching of collected SNMP variables pr. ipdevpoll SNMP session.

  * Various tweaks to avoid producing unnecessary SNMP queries.

  * Added database indexes for some potentially slow and frequently used
    queries.

  * Added ipdevpolld multiprocess option to run each job type as separate
    subprocess (enabling this will consume up to 60 PostgreSQL connections, be
    warned!)

  * An -n option was added to ipdevpolld. Used in combination with the -J
    option, ipdevpoll will run a single job for a single netbox as a
    foreground process.

  * When new jobs are added to the internal ipdevpoll job queues, boxes are
    prioritized in ascending order of last update time.  I.e. ipdevpoll will
    run jobs first for boxes that are new or haven't completed an inventory
    job in a long time.

    networkDiscovery Java program is now deprecated.

  * Alerts when SNMP agents stop responding.

  * Alerts on power failure SNMP traps from UPS units. UPS-MIB (RFC 1628) and

(released 01 Dec 2011)

 Improvements:

  * Using the `-d` option with cleanrrds.py will now also remove references to
    stale availability and response time RRD files from NAV's database.  This
    should help against the "Availability: N/A" issue seen by some in
    ipdevinfo, whereas bugfixes to pping should prevent it from creating new
    entries while leaving stale ones in the future.

(released 12 Aug 2011)

 Bugfixes:

  These two bugs were actually fixed in 3.9.0, but were omitted
  from the changelog:

               error, but an entry (without the prefix) is added to

Version 3.9.0
(released 01 Jul 2011)

 User-visible features and improvements:

  * WeatherGoose snmptrapd plugin now also supports WeatherGoose II traps.
  * Added portname information to port listings in Arnold.

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#736905 (Changing a vendor id creates a new vendor instead)

               position)
  * LP#787986 (No information collected for devices of unknown type)

Version 3.9.0b1
(released 20 May 2011)

 User-visible features and improvements:

  * NAV's threshold monitoring feature has finally been completed - Threshold
    Manager is a new web tool that allows adjusting threshold values for
    individual statistical data sources.  Alerts generated by the threshold
    monitor can be subscribed to in users' alert profiles.

  * MAC Watch is a new web tool that maintains a watch list of MAC addresses.
    Whenever a watched MAC address appears on your network, NAV will send an
    alert that can be subscribed to.

  * ipdevpoll can now retrieve VLAN configuration from Extreme Networks
    devices.

  * ipdevpoll can now optionally use the pynetsnmp library as an alternative
    to the TwistedSNMP/PySNMP combination.  pynetsnmp is a ctypes binding to
    the well-known NetSNMP library, and should noticeably improve performance
    if used.

  * Layer 2 topology discovery has been rewritten from scratch, due to both
    problems with the results of the old discovery code and problems with
    maintaining the old code.

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#739718 (ifName should be derived from baseport number if not available)

Version 3.8.2
(released 3 March 2011)

 - This maintenance release fixes compatibility with newer versions of Django
   and Cheetah.

 - Changelog for 3.8.1 forgot to mention the addition of a new "offline
   devices" report.  The report lists serial numbers of devices known to NAV,
   but now appear to have been shelved.

 - NOTE: Users on upgraded installations should update their status
   preferences.  A missing setting in the default preferences assigned to all
   new users would cause the status system to not display devices on
   maintenance in the "maintenance" section unless they were actually down or
   in shadow (as described in LP#723688).

   After the upgrade, go to `Status` -> `Preferences` -> `IP Devices on
   Maintenance` and add `Up` to the list of states to display.  This choice
   was previously not enabled.

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#591602 (Endtime in maintenance period overwritten by a shorter
               maintenance period)
  * LP#720669 (can't add components to maintenance task when existing
               components have been deleted)
  * LP#721270 (CSRF Verification Fails on Django 1.2)
  * LP#721273 (Multiple NAV pages crash on non-ASCII chars under Cheetah 2.4)
  * LP#723619 (Maintenance crashes when adding multiple netboxes to a task)
  * LP#723688 (Status doesn't show devices on maintenance)
  * LP#724266 (MachineTracker inactive search says all IPs are inactive)
  * LP#724322 (netbox.uptodate is not altered when saving in seeddb)
  * LP#726402 (Rooms should be listed alphabetically when editing IP devices)
  * LP#726472 (portadmin should report error when snmp write is not available)
  * LP#726524 (prefix net type classification may be wrong on first discovery)
  * LP#728336 (`nav version` cannot find version information in NAV 3.8)


Version 3.8.1
(released 17 February 2011)

 Bugfixes:

  * Various problems with the 3.8 build/install system, discovered during
    Debian packaging.

  * LP#618555 (alert addresses are not validated by alert profiles ui)
  * LP#646708 (ipdevpoll fails to shutdown)
  * LP#667771 (LDAP fallback to local password authentication regression)
  * LP#715801 (Wrong gwcount in prefix report)
  * LP#715807 (Prefix net types are wrongly classified when single router has
               multiple addresses)
  * LP#715851 (Missing config files during 3.8.0 install)
  * LP#717144 (problem adding position cords on room)
  * LP#719232 (AlertEngine crash error: filter() argument after ** must be a
               dictionary)
  * LP#720024 (logengine crashes when message contains : characters)


Version 3.8.0
(released 3 February 2011)

 User-visible features and improvements:

  * The database schema can now be kept updated automatically using the new
    `syncdb.py` program. Please see the `NOTES` file, and run the program as
    soon as you've upgraded.

  * NAV can now configure descriptions and access VLANs on your switch ports
    when an SNMP write community is set for a switch.  This functionality is
    accessible through the IP Device Info tool.

  * SeedDB has been rewritten to use the Django framework (and has
    subsequently been reduced from nearly 5000 lines of spaghetti code to just
    below 2000 maintainable lines).

  * The number of concurrent ipdevpoll jobs can now be limited on a per-job
    basis, to ease the load on your system if so desired. See the annotated
    `ipdevpoll.conf` file.

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#643550 (Include ipdevinfo links in switch search in machine tracker)
  * LP#545029 (SmbChecker runs out of available file descriptors)


Version 3.7.4
(released 27 January 2011)

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#645892 (report: csv export does not export full report)
              This wasn't properly fixed in 3.6.0.
  * LP#702796 (Syntax error in HttpChecker.py)

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#537220 (logengine ignores seconds from timestamps)
  * LP#562242 (Prefix matrix crashes when viewing IPv6 scope)
  * LP#689629 (ipdevinfo crashes on IP addresses on VLANs that have no VLAN ID)
  * LP#691571 (old serial no association should be cleared when ip device is
               replaced with new hardware)
  * LP#692580 (delete location crashes)
  * LP#692997 (Machine tracker crashes due to limitations in allowed interface
               names)
  * LP#701451 (snmptrapd fails to decode certain SNMPv1 traps)
  * LP#701453 (snmptrapd fails to parse SNMPv2 traps from WeatherGoose)
  * LP#702257 (alertengine crashes after alert profile is deleted)

 Improvements:

  * if loglevels are set to DEBUG, ipdevpoll will now log full details of
    stackframes when unhandled errors occur.

Version 3.7.2
(released 23 December 2010)

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#586334 (HTTPS service checker doesn't work with Python 2.6)
  * LP#649761 (ipdevinfo does not show router port IPs/prefixes)
  * LP#649767 (ipdevpoll should be able to exclude prefixes via configuration)

#####################################################################

 New features and improvements:

  * Main SNMP collector rewritten from scratch, using Python.  The new design
    specifically avoids Cisco-centric assumptions, and should improve equipment
    support over time.

  * Various improvements to the data model:

    - All interfaces are now registered in the same table.  Switch ports have
      switch port numbers, while router ports have (layer 3) IP addresses
      attached.  Interfaces of seemingly other categories are also registered.

    - Allows interfaces to relate directly to an IP device.  This also means
      that NAV will no longer create fake modules for chassis-only devices.

    - Modules are now identified by textual names, not integers.  This is to
      support vendors that do not necessarily number modules.

  * MailIn, a framework for parsing e-mail alerts from third party systems and
    injecting events into NAV's event and alert queue.

  * Enhanced report tool flexibility.  Reports now support any valid
    PostgreSQL statement.

  * The report tool can now export results to downloadable CSV files.

  * Added a simple availability report summarizing all downtime during the last
    month.

  * Ignoring resolved alerts is now supported when queueing alerts in an alert
    profile.

  * The defunct device management tool has been replaced by a pure Device
    history tool.

  * The IP Info tool has been merged into the IP Device Info tool.

  * The Machine Tracker has been rewritten using Django.

  * Makecricketconfig has been rewritten in Python, and allows for more
    flexibility in configuring Cricket for statistics collection.

  * forgetSQL and psycopg1 dependencies have been removed.

 Bugfixes:

  * LP#483524 (Arnold: Make mistaken enabling of ports less likely)
  * LP#425700 (Arnold mac-search)
  * LP#411817 (logengine shouldn't delete messages on every run)

 New features and improvements:

  * Radius accounting module added.  Enables NAV to store accounting logs from
    FreeRADIUS servers in the database, and search this data in the web
    interface.

    for those who have non-SwitchStack devices from HP.  See release NOTES for
    more information about migrating to this version if you monitor HP
    devices.

  * The report tool now displays the timestamp of report results.  This
    enables the user to see whether the results are retrieved live or from the
    report cache.  The cache is now also invalidated immediately if the report
    configuration files are changed.

 New features and improvements:

  * New messages and maintenance web tools, rewritten from scratch, replace the
    old messages system. The maintenance tool features a calendar for ease of
    use.

  * SMS Daemon rewritten in Python, now extensible with dispatcher plugins.
    Existing plugins for Gammu, Boost Communications (www.boostcom.no) and
    e-mail gateways.

  * New link from alert profiles enables users to see their own SMS queues.

  * More information and links in the IP Device Browser. Among other things:
    New color for 10gig ports, displays serial number, displays software
    version and displays "first discovered by NAV" time.

  * Full description (ifAlias) string now stored for gwports too.

  * All reports have been revised.  A new report lists unrecognized CDP
    neighbours seen by NAV.  Reports now display 1000 rows per page by default,
    instead of 100.

  * The status page now shows devices and services on maintenance.

  * A new tool to show ranked statistical data collected by NAV/Cricket.
    Useful for checking which routers/switches have the highest CPU
    utilization, which interfaces have the most traffic, etc.

  * NAV now configures Cricket to utilize 64-bit traffic counters where
    applicable, preventing counter wrap-around problems for saturated links and
    reducing collection frequency for gigabit interfaces from once a 1 minute
    to once every 5 minutes.

  * Room IDs can now be changed in EditDB

  * The OID tester component of getDeviceData now runs faster, by not issuing
    unnecessary indexed community snmp queries.

  * New About-page in web interface.

  * HTML templates restructured, much of the web interface will now validate as
    XHTML 1.0 Transitional.

  * NAV installation can now properly report its own version number.

  * JVM options can now be configured individually for Java bases subsystems in
    nav.conf.  Java subsystems can now also be configured to use an alternate
    JVM installation using the JAVA_HOME variable in nav.conf.

  * Cleaned up output from nav start/stop/status commands, to increase
    legibility.

  * Removed gDD dependency on the system's /usr/bin/host program.

  * Arplogger now ignores routers that are known to be down, instead of spewing
    SNMP query errors by e-mail.

  * IP Devices can now be deleted directly from the Edit IP Device form in
    EditDB.

  * Nice, new icons for several web tools, now with SVG source files.

 Bugfixes:

  * Many SQL errors related to missing tables in FROM clauses fixed.

  * Fixed bug #1551839 (Cannot change IP address in EditDB)

  * Fixed bug #1602315 (EditDB crashes when attempting to delete rooms in use)

  * Fixed bug #1643321 (EditDB crashes when entering invalid IP address)

  * Fixed bug which crashed EditDB when devices returned SNMP Integer values as
    serial numbers.

  * Arnold now properly blocks switch ports on HP equipment.

  * Changed inefficient hash indexes which caused the logengine (syslog
    analyzer) to run extremely slowly and PostgreSQL to run up an insane server
    load.

  * Fixed bug that occurred spuriously, causing the Prefix Matrix to believe an
    entire network scope was a subnet on its own.

  * makecricketconfig.pl would set strange umask values when writing
    cricket-config, which would cause permission problems and possibly make
    graphs disappear from the Cricket web interface.

  * ... and various other small bugs.


Version 3.1.1
(released 08 November 2006)

 Security fixes:

 * The session mechanism of the web interface contained a potential directory
   traversal vulnerability.  A mitigating factor was that an attacker would
   first need write access to the local file system of the NAV server.  The
   vulnerability was discovered by Jim Gallacher, and is similar to a
   vulnerability discovered in mod_python:
   http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-135

 Bugfixes:

 * getDeviceData no longer attempts to map Cisco submodules into NAV's data
   model.  This solves several Cisco related module problems.

 * Any module without switch ports would erroneously be detected as down when
   the module monitor ran single handedly.  Typically, they would stay marked
   as down for five hours, go up for one hour, then down again for another
   five (#1583453).

 * getDeviceData threads working with equipment that enabled VLANs above 1023
   would crash, causing incomplete information to be collected from these
   devices..  It no longer crashes, but NAV still will not properly support
   more than 1024 vlans (#1518783)

 * getDeviceData should no longer generate repeated, incorrect
   deviceHwVerChanged alerts for HP equipment (#1550393).

 * Fixed bug that would cause a getDeviceData collector thread to crash when a
   device appeared not to support the ifHighSpeed OID.

 * A couple of getDeviceData plugins had NullPointerExceptions.

 * Initial Cricket/makecricketconfig setup was botched after directory
   restructuing.  Makecricketconfig is now more flexible when locating a
   system's cricket installation, and where its config and data are placed.

 * Some SQL errors in EditDB were fixed.

 * Fixed bugs in SNMP getnext handling in EditDB.

 * Fixed an EditDB hardcoded limitation of 10 characters in an IP device's
   orgid field - the database allows up to 30 characters.

 * EditDB would crash when inserting devices that happened to return non-ASCII
   serial numbers.  Non-ASCII serial numbers are now ignored.

 * Removed code from networkDiscovery that attempted to traverse non-routed
   VLANs.  This code was not properly tested, and potentially caused several
   topology related problems.

 * Build/install errors related to Arnold were fixed.

 * A bug caused by hardcoded values in Arnold prevented it from blocking ports
   on equipment of other categories than EDGE, even if it was configured to
   allow this.

 * Status page preferences no longer crashes with a Python traceback
   (#1521695).

 * The Traffic Map admin buttons no longer disappear when the Traffic Map
   applet is reloaded (#1495566).

 * The traffic map would never display any load data for links on interfaces
   with spaces in their names (such as ATM interfaces on Cisco devices).

 * The "black load" syndrome of the Traffic Map has been compensated for.

 * The cam collector would not insert port numbers in cam records unless NAV
   had collected proper ifName/ifDescr values for the ports in question.

 * The pping and servicemon processes now properly perform a double fork and
   detach completely from the controlling terminal when daemonized.  When the
   daemons had been started/restarted in an SSH session, this bug would
   sometimes cause said SSH session to hang on logout.

 * Fixed a bug which rendered NAV's Cheetah templates incompatible with
   Cheetah 2.

 * Various other small bugfixes and cosmetic changes.

#####################################################################

 New features and improvements:

 * Arnold, a subsystem to block users' switch ports by using NAV's
   Machine Tracker data.

 * IP Information Center web tool, displays any information NAV has on
   single IP addresses.

 * Extra tab on IP Device Center to illustrate switch port usage.

 * The IP Device Center will now display a device's software version,
   and a timestamp of the last update made by getDeviceData.

 * A "refresh" link on the IP Device Center allows the user to trigger
   a new collection run to refresh the device data.

 * l2trace web tool, enables users to trace network paths on layer
   two.

 * Autodiscovery command line tool added to contrib.  This tool will
   try to discover every managed network device within your network,
   and add them to NAV.

 * All logged in users are now considered members of the new system
   group "Authenticated Users".  Minimum privileges for authenticated
   users can be granted to this group.

 * Password hashes stored in the account database are now salted, for
   slightly enhanced security.

 * NAV now supports reading interface speeds from the ifHighSpeed OID,
   thus supporting speeds above 4.2Gbps.

 * Initial db setup now suggests creating only one database user,
   instead of the previous two.

 Bugfixes:

 * Dependency on pysnmp=3.3.5 (the unstable dev branch) has been
   removed, please downgrade to pysnmp 2.

 * EditDB no longer crashes when adding devices that report duplicate
   serial numbers.

 * AlertEngine would crash when concatenating several queued alerts
   into one SMS message.

 * AlertEngine would, under certain circumstances, not delete a user's
   queued alerts, resulting in constant retransmission of the same
   queued alerts.

 * Some improved debug logging in AlertEngine.

 * DNS lookups in getDeviceData are slightly more robust.

 * The cam logger now runs 4 times an hour, as opposed to once every
   hour, which was not a very good default.

 * Missing Traffic Map icons were added.

 * Machine Tracker would crash when doing DNS lookups on inactive host
   searches (#1509944).

Version 3.0.1
(released 28 April 2006)

 Security fixes:

 * The report interface failed to properly sanitize user input,
   potentially allowing for SQL injections.

 Bugfixes:

 * Some modules import python profiling modules that aren't always
   part of the standard distribution.

 * pping would crash if there was no route to a host.

 * SQL Errors in the server and trunked core switch ports reports.

 * Some devices would never be taken off maintenance.

 * The default web greeting still mentioned the word "beta"

 * The SMTP service checker didn't properly extract version
   information from all SMTP server banners.

 * Registering mixed case device names as sysnames or DNS names would
   result in dnsMismatch alerts.

 * dnsMismatch alert text would use the DNS name as both the sysname
   and DNS name values, confusing the receiver as to what the actual
   problem was.

 * getBoksMacs/mactrace would crash under specific, hard to reproduce
   circumstances.

 * There were potential syntax errors in the NAV perl API with newer
   Perl versions.

 * Some NAV processes would not gracefully close database connections
   on exit.

 * Several parts of the web interface would report InterfaceErrors if
   a database connection was temporarily dropped by the database
   server.  Please report any further occurrences of these errors.

 * Newer versions of Firefox would not properly render the table
   graphics of the web interface.

 * The machine tracker would not properly sanitize user input IP
   addresses, leading to strange errors and backtraces in the web
   interface.

 * The Alert Engine would did not delete processed entries from the
   alert queue, which caused the database table to grow indefinitely.

 * Much of the Alert Engine's debug logs were unreadable because they
   referred to many entities by their internal database IDs.

 * The type information shipped with NAV incorrectly specified that
   Cisco 3750 and 2970 based devices did not support the cs@vlan
   convention, thus disabling proper CAM table collection from these
   devices.

 * The HTML on the NAV login page would be sent as plain text under
   newer versions of mod_python.


Version 3.0.0
(released 16 September 2005)

 Improvements:

 * Fixed a bug in maintengine which prevented it from doing it's job when the
   database was busy/overloaded.

 * Fixed a bug in the integration between Alert Profiles (PHP) and the Cheetah
   templating system (Python), which would cause the Alert Profiles web
   interface to act up.

 * Character coding information added to all NAV-original Python programs.

 * Fixed a bug which cleared a user's password if the account editing form of
   Useradmin was submitted without changes.

 * NetworkDiscovery now only checks for closed vlans on active ports.

 * Fixed a NullPointerException in getDeviceData.

 * Fixed various problems with Cisco module/submodule translation in
   getDeviceData.

 * Fixed a AlertEngine/getDeviceData combination bug which caused AlertEngine
   to log loads of long error messages on events that lacked an alerttype
   suggestion.

 * New option to have AlertEngine log error messages to a separate error log.

 * AlertEngine now sends error alerts if an alerttype has no configured subject
   line in alertmsg.conf.

 * Added report shortcut to search for strings in prefix-netident (added to the
   front.html config file)

 * Added link from Report to the previously hidden feature "service matrix" of
   the IP Device Center (added to the front.html config file)


Version 3.0_rc2
(released 20 July 2005)

 Improvements:

 * More data for the snmpoid table, please run the new snmpoid.sql to
   ensure your system will work after an upgrade.

 * The Service Monitor's RPC plugin no longer complains loudly to
   stderr.

 * The Messages and Report web interfaces will no longer
   intermittently cross-over mysteriously.

 * The alert message texts have been updated to contain messages for
   all known alerts.

 * Overlapping time periods in an alert profile will no longer cause
   double alerts to be sent.

 * Modules that are down can now actually be found and deleted in the
   Device Management interface.

 * The Traffic Map system and Network Explorer can now be properly
   configured to run without a single NAV root directory.

 * Alert Profiles web pages now include the correct stylesheets, so it
   won't look as funny.

 * Several getDeviceData-related problems were ironed out.

 * The menu on Messages' maintenance list is no longer ugly.

 * IP devices put on maintenance will now be taken off maintenance,
   instead of remaining on maintenance forever.

 * Maintenance-scheduled IP devices can now be properly deleted from
   messages.

 * Next/previous page-links in reports will now work properly even
   when using advanced search options.  Also, advanced searching on
   database fields that contain underscores (like sw_ver) will now
   work.

 * Performance improvements in the IP Device Center.

 Improvements:

 * Eventengine BoxState plugin now uses a queue for boxes down in
   order to ensure that we don't send out boxdown alerts prematurely.

 * The Gwport plugin of getDeviceData has been rewritten and should
   be much more stable (less restarts of gDD necessary).

 * Most of the reports in the report generator have been optimized and
   will display much more quickly than before.

 * Various improvements to Cricket to better cope with changes. This
   should make vlanPlot display the network load more reliably.

 * Send email for boxShadow and boxSunny.

 * WLAN devices are correctly detected as being in shadow.

 * Only allow editing of prefixes where the nettype table says it's
   editable.

 * Attempt to fix several instances of bad HTML markup in the report
   generator, which would break on various browsers.

 * Attempt to get the module number of Cisco devices correct in more
   cases.

 * Handle the case of duplicate module serials in a graceful manner.

 * gDD collects data every 6 hours by default, although the default
   is only for new devices. The collection frequency can be changed by
   setting the 'frequency' field in the netboxsnmpoid table, and the
   default value can be changed in getDeviceData.conf.

 * Add option for setting the logging level for NAV subsystems in
   nav.conf.

 * Try to also discover closed / private VLANs.

 * Support for PIDs > 65535 in pping (typical on FreeBSD).

 * Add a 'monitor' thread to the cam-logger which exits the process
   if it hangs for some reason.

 * Using a separate database server has been tested and all NAV
   subsystems should now support this.

 Improvements:

 * gDD now makes sure to give priority to new devices when its work
   load with old devices is high.
 * gDD now refers to IP Devices by sysname in its logs, making it
   easier to track its actions when reading the logs.
 * gDD now correctly updates the netident of elinks.
 * gDD will now also attempt to extract software version information
   from a device's sysDescr OID (also collects sw_ver for the device
   itself, and not just its modules).
 * A bug that prevented the service monitor's LDAP plugin from
   functioning from time to time was fixed.
 * Router ports that are administratively down are removed from NAVdb
   by gDD.
 * The report generator now supports multi-line and complex SQL
   queries.
 * The SQL queries of the netbox, gw, sw, edge and wlan reports were
   optimized for speed.

 Additions:

 * gDD will now collect memory information from devices.


Version 3.0_beta9
(released 21 January 2005)

 User-visible changes:

 * For performance reasons, the WestHawk Java SNMP library has been
   discarded in favor of Java SNMP, which has a nice GPL license and
   doesn't hog resources by creating lots of threads.
 * Machine tracker searches have been redone to be more like in NAV 2,
   due to the complexity of automatic attempts at correlating CAM and
   ARP records.1
 * Makecricketconfig should now generate correct interface
   descriptions for router interfaces in Cricket.
 * The previously disabled Server statistics support of
   Makecricketconfig has ben re-enabled and fixed.
 * Start/stop scripts now use "su -" when switching from root to
   navcron, to reset the environment before starting processes.  This
   may have adverse effects if root has his/her environment variables
   set to locate NAV libraries while the navcron user doesn't.
 * The report system should now correctly count the number of gwports
   registered for a device in NAVdb.
 * Edit database no longer throws exceptions if NAVdb contains
   organizations without descriptions.
 * The default priorities of the web tools have been adjusted.
 * getDeviceData should no longer come out of sync with NAVdb, as it
   no longer works on a memory cache of the NAVdb.
 * getDeviceData no longer deletes prefixes of the 'scope' type (which
   makes the prefix matrix of the Report system work again).
 * Improvements to the module monitor of getDeviceData.
 * Load data is now available in the Traffic map.

Known bugs in this version:

 * getDeviceData will at times seemingly "forget" some IP devices and
   stop retrieving updated information from them.  Until this has been
   fixed, this can be worked around by restarting getDeviceData,
   either on a regular basis, or when inconsistencies between NAVdb
   and the real world are seen.

 User-visible changes:
 * Encoding info has been added to several python modules, to make
   newer versions of Python stop complaining about PEP 0263.  But
   there are probably more modules that need these changes.
 * Attempting to stop not running cron services using the nav command
   will no longer yield a Python exception.
 * Alert profiles containing time periods spanning across midnight
   will now work.
 * Interface names containing more than one forward slash now work
   with makecricketconfig.
 * Added config file cricket-views.conf to define which views
   makecricketconfig will create.
 * Several editdb crash bugs were fixed.
 * Default set of reports (report.conf) were bugfixed.
 * MachineTracker had a serious design flaw in its primary SQL
   statement, which would cause arbitrary and erroneous search result.
   The automatic combination of arp and cam data should now be more
   accurate.
 * When there are no active messages, the annoying "No Found" message
   is no longer displayed on the home page.
 * Some missing icons have been added, and new icons for some tools.
 * Some strange errors on the web were due to small differences in
   mod_python versions used on Apache 1.3 and Apache 2, the ones that
   have been found have been fixed.
 * Tremendous amount of fixes related to the getDeviceData collection
   system, more accurate collection of module information and module
   state, detection of replaced netboxes, etc.
 * Errors in getDeviceData and missing constraints in the database
   would sometimes cause several netboxes and/or several modules to
   refer to the same device and serial number (which is supposed to be
   impossible).  This has been fixed.
 * Improvements to vlanPlot layout, including links to IP device
   center and Network Explorer.  Will now also display an error
   message when contact cannot be establishwith the vPServer, whereas
   previously it would only present a blank screen.
